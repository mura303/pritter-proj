= What is it?
An interface to Win32 services.  It also allows you to create an run Ruby
programs as a Service.

= Installation
== Gem Install
   ruby win32-service.gemspec
   gem install win32-service-X.Y.Z.gem
== Standard Install
   ruby extconf.rb
   nmake
   cd test; ruby tc_service.rb; ruby tc_daemon.rb (optional)
   nmake install

= Where are the docs?
In the 'doc' directory, or you can generate rdoc from the source files.

= Possible errors
* Service.delete causes "Unable to delete: The specified service has
been marked for deletion."
 
This can be caused by two things.  Either you attempted to delete a running
service without stopping it first, or you have the Services administrative 
tool (GUI) open.  The solution is to first stop the service if it's running
and close the Services GUI admin tool before deleting.
	
* Service.start causes, "The service did not respond to the start or control
request in a timely fashion."

There are a few possibilities, but I'll just mention the ones I can speak of
from personal experience.  The most likely cause for this error is that there
is a bug in your Daemon class.  Unfortunately, it isn't stated in the
error message or the Event log as to what might be wrong.  You'll have to
debug your class separately somehow.  One approach might be to do
STDERR.reopen("C:\\errors.txt"), or something similar, at the top of your
Daemon code, or wrap the whole thing in a begin/rescue clause, and write the
errors to a file.

The other possibility is that your binary path name is incorrect.  The
solution in the latter case is to use an absolute path name for the target
Ruby script.  It might also be a good idea to include the full path name to
the Ruby interpreter, e.g. 'c:\ruby\bin\ruby' versus just 'ruby'.

= Possible test failures
The 'test_start_stop' test in the tc_service.rb file may fail.  This will
happen if your W32Time service isn't running.
